# Additional control implemented here. These groups allow you to control which
# services run on which hosts at a per-service level.
#
# Word of caution: Some services are required to run on the same host to
# function appropriately. For example, neutron-metadata-agent must run on the
# same host as the l3-agent and (depending on configuration) the dhcp-agent.
