- name: Warn about Train upgrade
  debug:
    msg: >-
      In Train, Tacker started using local filesystem to store VNF
      packages and CSAR files.
      Kolla Ansible provides no shared filesystem capabilities, hence only
      one instance of each Tacker service is deployed and all on the same host.
      Previous multinode deployments will be descaled when running upgrade.
