# This configuration file is used to configure proxysql rules,
# in our case we define the schemaname and the mysql galera cluster
# group which query is routed to.
#
# Query rules are a very powerful vehicle to control traffic passing
# through ProxySQL and are configured in the mysql_query_rules table:
#
# ProxySQL Admin> SHOW CREATE TABLE mysql_query_rules\G
#
# https://proxysql.com/documentation/main-runtime/#mysql_query_rules
mysql_query_rules:
{% for rule in proxysql_project_database_shard['rules'] %}
{%     set _writer_group = rule['shard_id'] | int * 10 %}
{%     if rule['schema'] is defined %}
  - schemaname: "{{ rule['schema'] }}"
    destination_hostgroup: {{ _writer_group }}
    apply: 1
    active: 1
{%     endif %}
{%     if rule['user'] is defined %}
  - username: "{{ rule['user'] }}"
    destination_hostgroup: {{ _writer_group }}
    apply: 1
    active: 1
{%     endif %}
{% endfor %}
