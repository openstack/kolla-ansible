# NOTE(kevko): We have to ignore errors
# as new deployments have no galera
# running. In that case, user will be created
# in mariadb role.
#
# It doesn't matter that creating monitor user
# is also in the mariadb role.
#
# If user is switching from haproxy to proxysql,
# monitor user has to be created before proxysql
# will start, otherwise proxysql will evaluate
# mariadb backends are down, because no monitor
# user (only old haproxy user without pass).
#
# Creating monitor user in mariadb role is too late.
