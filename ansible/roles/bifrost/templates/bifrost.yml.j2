# Ironic creates hardlinks between the TFTP master image store and the
# HTTP root path when iPXE is enabled. With Docker volumes used for these
# locations we run into https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1507894
# during deployment. If we use a directory under /httpboot to store the
# master images this issue is avoided.

# Bifrost in Yoga changed the default TFTP and HTTP boot directories to reside
