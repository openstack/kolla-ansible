# NOTE(mgoddard): Currently (just prior to Stein release), sending SIGHUP to
# nova compute services leaves them in a broken state in which they cannot
# start new instances. The following error is seen in the logs:
# "In shutdown, no new events can be scheduled"
# To work around this we restart the nova-compute services.
# Speaking to the nova team, this seems to be an issue in oslo.service,
# with a fix proposed here: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/641907.
# This issue also seems to affect the proxy services, which exit non-zero in
# response to a SIGHUP, so restart those too.
# The issue actually affects all nova services, since they remain with RPC
# version pinned to the previous release:
# https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1833069.
# TODO(mgoddard): Use SIGHUP when this bug has been fixed.

# NOTE(mgoddard): We use recreate_or_restart_container to cover the case where
# nova_safety_upgrade is "yes", and we need to recreate all containers.

# FIXME(mgoddard): Need to always do this since nova-compute handlers will not
# generally fire on controllers.
