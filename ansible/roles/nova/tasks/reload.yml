# This play calls sighup on every service to refresh upgrade levels

# NOTE(mgoddard): Currently (just prior to Stein release), sending SIGHUP to
# nova compute services leaves them in a broken state in which they cannot
# start new instances. The following error is seen in the logs:
# "In shutdown, no new events can be scheduled"
# To work around this we restart the nova-compute services.
# Speaking to the nova team, this seems to be an issue in oslo.service,
# with a fix proposed here: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/641907.
# This issue also seems to affect the proxy services, which exit non-zero in
# reponse to a SIGHUP, so restart those too.
# TODO(mgoddard): Remove this workaround when this bug has been fixed.
