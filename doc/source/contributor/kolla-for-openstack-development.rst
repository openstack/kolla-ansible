Using Kolla For OpenStack Development
=====================================

Kolla-ansible can be used to deploy containers in a way suitable for doing
development on OpenStack services.

Heat was the first service to be supported, and so the following will use
submitting a patch to Heat using Kolla as an example.

.. warning::

   Kolla dev mode is intended for OpenStack hacking or development only.
   Do not use this in production!

Enabling Kolla "dev mode"
-------------------------

To enable dev mode for all supported services, set in
``/etc/kolla/globals.yml``:

.. path /etc/kolla/globals.yml
.. code-block:: yaml

   kolla_dev_mode: true

To enable it just for heat, set:

.. path /etc/kolla/globals.yml
.. code-block:: yaml

   heat_dev_mode: true

Usage
-----

When enabled, the source repo for the service in question will be cloned under
``/opt/stack/`` on the target node(s). This will be bind mounted to
container's ``/dev-mode`` directory. From there, it will be installed at every
startup of the container using ``kolla_install_projects`` script.

After making code changes, simply restart the container to pick them up:

.. code-block:: console

   docker restart heat_api

Debugging
---------

``remote_pdb`` can be used to perform debugging with Kolla containers. First,
make sure it is installed in the container in question:

.. code-block:: console

   docker exec -it -u root heat_api pip install remote_pdb

Then, set your breakpoint as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   from remote_pdb import RemotePdb
   RemotePdb('127.0.0.1', 4444).set_trace()

Once you run the code(restart the container), pdb can be accessed using
``socat``:

.. code-block:: console

   socat readline tcp:127.0.0.1:4444
