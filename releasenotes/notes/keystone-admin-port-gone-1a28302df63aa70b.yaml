deprecations:
  - |
    Variables ``keystone_admin_port``, ``keystone_admin_url`` and
    ``admin_protocol`` are deprecated for removal after Zed.
upgrade:
  - |
    Keystone's admin interface no longer points to a separate port.
    On upgrade, the port is preserved to maintain the intermediate
    compatibility. Users are advised to run the deploy and post-deploy
    commands afterwards to ensure port's cleanup.
    For more information, please refer to the docs.
    Please note that the relevant variables ``keystone_admin_port``,
    ``keystone_admin_url`` and ``admin_protocol`` are no longer used
    and are deprecated for removal after Zed. Please cease their usage
    in your customisations.
