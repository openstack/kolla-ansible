features:
  - |
    ProxySQL is now enabled automatically whenever MariaDB is enabled, and the
    container health check now uses the upstream
    `healthcheck.sh <https://mariadb.com/docs/server/server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/installing-mariadb/binary-packages/automated-mariadb-deployment-and-administration/docker-and-mariadb/using-healthcheck-sh>`__
    script instead of ``clustercheck``.
upgrade:
  - |
    The HAProxy + ``clustercheck`` backend for MariaDB is no longer supported.
    Running ``kolla-ansible upgrade`` now deploys ProxySQL and removes the old
    ``clustercheck`` containers automatically.
