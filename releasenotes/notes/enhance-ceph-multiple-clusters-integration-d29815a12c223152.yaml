features:
  - |
    Improved the handling of multiple Ceph clusters in Kolla-Ansible
    by allowing explicit configuration of users, pools, and cluster
    names, following the official Ceph keyring format
    ``$cluster.client.$user.keyring``.
upgrade:
  - |
    The variables ``ceph_cinder_keyring``, ``ceph_cinder_backup_keyring``,
    ``ceph_glance_keyring``, ``ceph_gnocchi_keyring``, ``ceph_manila_keyring``,
    and ``ceph_nova_keyring`` have been removed, and their values are now
    automatically derived from the configurable Ceph users. Users who have
    relied on completely different keyrings or custom user configurations
    should ensure their setups are correctly aligned with the new convention
    as per `documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/reference/storage/external-ceph-guide.html>`__.
