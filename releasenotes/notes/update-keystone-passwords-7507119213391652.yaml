    Changes to service user passwords in ``passwords.yml`` will now be applied
    when reconfiguring services.

    This behaviour can reverted by setting
    ``update_keystone_service_user_passwords: false``.

    If credentials are updated in ``passwords.yml`` kolla-ansible is now able
    to update these credentials in the keystone database and in the on disk
    config files.

    The changes to ``passwords.yml`` are applied once ``kolla-ansible -i
    INVENTORY`` reconfigure has been run.

    If you want to revert to the old behavior - credentials not automatically
    updating during reconfigure if they changed in ``passwords.yml`` - you can
    specify this by setting ``update_keystone_service_user_passwords: false``
    in your globals.yml.

    Notice that passwords are only changed if you change them in
    ``passwords.yml``. This mechanism is not a complete solution for automatic
    credential rollover. No passwords are changed if you do not change them
    inside ``passwords.yml``.
