    Implement jinja filters for service dicts.
    Using select_services_enabled_and_mapped_to_host
    filter gets rid of some overhead caused by
    ansible skipping items in tasks.
    With bigger amount of hosts, this overhead
    is non-insignificant.
    Usage of service_enabled_and_mapped_to_host
    filter is mostly cosmetic and has no effect
    on the performance.
