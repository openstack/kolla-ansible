    Fixed bug `#2039498
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/2039498>`__ where the Grafana
    docker volume was bind mounted over Grafana plugins installed at image
    build time. This was fixed by copying the dashboards into the container
    from an existing bind mount instead of using the ``grafana`` volume.
    However, this leaves behind the volume, which can be removed by setting
    ``grafana_remove_old_volume`` to ``true``. Please note that any plugins
    installed via the CLI directly and not through Kolla will be lost when
    doing this. In a future release, ``grafana_remove_old_volume`` will default
    to ``true``.

    The ``grafana`` volume is no longer used. If you wish to automatically
    remove the old volume, set ``grafana_remove_old_volume`` to ``true``. Note
    that doing this will lose any plugins installed via the CLI directly and
    not through Kolla. If you have previously installed Grafana plugins via the
    Grafana UI or CLI, you must change to installing them at image `build time
    <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla/latest/admin/image-building.html#dockerfile-customisation>`__.
    The Grafana volume, which contains existing custom plugins, will be
    automatically removed in the D release.
