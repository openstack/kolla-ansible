upgrade:
  - |
    The bootloader used to boot Ironic nodes in UEFI boot mode during
    inspection when iPXE is enabled has been changed from ``ipxe.efi`` to
    ``snponly.efi``. This is in line with the default UEFI iPXE bootloader used
    in Ironic since the Xena release. The bootloader may be changed via
    ``ironic_dnsmasq_uefi_ipxe_boot_file``.
