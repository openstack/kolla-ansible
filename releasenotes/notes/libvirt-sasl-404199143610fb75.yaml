features:
  - |
    Adds support for libvirt SASL authentication. It is enabled by default.
    `LP#1964013 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1964013>`__
security:
  - |
    Fixes an issue where the default configuration of libvirt did not use
    authentication for the API exposed over TCP on the internal API network.
    This allowed anyone with access to the internal API network read-write
    access to libvirt. While the internal API network is typically trusted,
    other services on this network generally at least require authentication.

    SASL authentication is now enabled for libvirt by default. Kolla Ansible
    supports libvirt TLS since the Train release, and this is recommended to
    provide a higher level of security. `LP#1964013
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1964013>`__
upgrade:
  - |
    The addition of libvirt SASL authentication requires a new password in
    ``passwords.yml``, ``libvirt_sasl_password``. This may be generated using
    the existing ``kolla-genpwd`` and ``kolla-mergepwd`` tooling.
  - |
    The addition of libvirt SASL authentication requires both the
    ``nova_libvirt`` and ``nova_compute`` containers to be updated
    simultaneously, using new images with the necessary Cyrus SASL
    dependencies, as well as configuration containing the SASL credentials.
