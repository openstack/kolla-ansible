upgrade:
  - |
    In RabbitMQ, messages now have a TTL of 10 minutes and inactive queues will
    expire after 1 hour. These queue arguments can be changed dynamically at
    runtime [1], but it should be noted that applying a TTL to queues which
    already have messages will discard the messages when specific events occur.
    See [2] for more details. Note that the contents of the RabbitMQ
    definitions.json are now changed, meaning RabbitMQ containers will be
    restarted on next deploy/upgrade.
