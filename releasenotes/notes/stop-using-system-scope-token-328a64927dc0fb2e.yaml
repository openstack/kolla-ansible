    OpenStack services (except Ironic and Keystone) stopped supporting
    the system scope in their API policy. Kolla who started using the
    system scope token during the OpenStack Xena release needs to revert
    it and use the project scope token to perform those services API
    operations. The Ironic and Keystone operations are still performed
    using the system scope token.
