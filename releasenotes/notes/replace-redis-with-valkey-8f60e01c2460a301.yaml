features:
  - |
    Added a Valkey role with Sentinel so deployments use Valkey instead of
    Redis without changing coordination endpoints.
upgrade:
  - |
    Redis has been replaced with Valkey. Before running ``kolla-ansible
    upgrade``, set ``enable_redis: "no"`` and ``enable_valkey: "yes"``
    in ``globals.yml``. The upgrade playbooks automatically migrate Redis
    data into Valkey using temporary ports and then switch back to the
    defaults.
