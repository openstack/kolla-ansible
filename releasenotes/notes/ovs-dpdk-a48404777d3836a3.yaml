    The Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) is a collection of userspace
    libraries and tools that facilitate the development of high-performance
    userspace networking applications. During the Pike cycle, kolla has been
    extended to support deploying OpenvSwitch with the dpdk netdev dataplane.
features:
  - |
    A new ovs-dpdk role has been introduced to support deploy OpenvSwitch with
    the userspace DPDK dataplane. This playbook has been tested on Centos and
    Ubuntu hosts and introduces a new enable_ovs_dpdk variable to control
    deployment of OVS with DPDK instead of kernel ovs.
  - |
    The ovs-dpdkctl.sh tool has been enhanced to enable automatic loading of
    DPDK compatible kernel modules.
  - |
    The ovs-dpdkctl.sh tool has been extended to configure per host
    tunnel ip address to enable vxlan and other tunnel networking.
issues:
  - |
    The ovs-dpdk role introduced this release has been tested on centos 7 and
    ubuntu 16.04 hosts. While both host operating systems can be used to deploy
    ovs-dpdk containers a conflict exists between the cgroups created by docker
    and systemd on centos. These conflicts prevent restarting the ovs-dpdk
    containers once deployed. This issue is not present on Ubuntu and is fixed
    in newer versions of systemd. Deploying the ovs-dpdk role on centos is not
    advised in production on CentOS hosts unless you have validated that this
    issue has been addressed.
upgrade:
  - |
    When upgrading ovs-dpdk it should be noted that this will always involve a
    dataplane outage. Unlike kernel OVS the dataplane for ovs-dpdk executes in
    the ovs-vswitchd process. As such it is recommended to always evacuate
    all vm workloads from a node running ovs-dpdk prior to upgrading.
other:
  - |
    Reconfiguring form kernel based OVS to OVS with DPDK has not been tested
    in this release. Changing ovs datapaths on a deployed node requires
    neutron config changes and libvirt xml changes for all running instances
    including a hard reboot of the vm. VMs deployed to an node running ovs-dpdk
    require hugepage backed memory to function correctly. As such it is not
    advised to convert an existing compute node to use ovs-dpdk
    if it currently has VMs deployed.
