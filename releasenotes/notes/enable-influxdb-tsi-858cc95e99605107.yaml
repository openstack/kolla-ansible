upgrade:
  - InfluxDB TSI is now enabled by default. It is recommended for all
    customers by InfluxData. If you do not want to enable it you can set
    the variable ``influxdb_enable_tsi`` to ``False`` in ``globals.yml``.
    Instructions to migrate existing data to the new, disk based format
    can be found at
    https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/administration/upgrading/
    If you do not follow the migration procedure, InfluxDB should continue
    to work, but this is not recommended.
