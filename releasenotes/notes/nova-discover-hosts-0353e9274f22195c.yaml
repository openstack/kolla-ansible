    Fixes an issue where a failure of any Nova compute service to register
    itself would cause only the host querying the nova API to fail.
    Now, only hosts that fail to register will fail the Kolla Ansible run.
    Alternatively, to fail all hosts in a cell when any compute service fails
    to register, set ``nova_compute_registration_fatal`` to ``true``.
