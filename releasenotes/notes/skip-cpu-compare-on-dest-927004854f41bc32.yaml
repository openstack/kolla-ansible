    Changes default value of nova libvirt driver setting
    ``skip_cpu_compare_on_dest`` to true. With the libvirt driver, during
    live migration, skip comparing guest CPU with the destination host.
    When using QEMU >= 2.9 and libvirt >= 4.4.0, libvirt will do the correct
    thing with respect to checking CPU compatibility on the destination host
    during live migration.
