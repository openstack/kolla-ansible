features:

    Support for both PXE and iPXE enabled in Ironic at the same time.
upgrade:
  - |
    Ironic volumes related to PXE (TFTP) and iPXE & direct deploy (HTTP)
    are refactored to share a common parent path at ``/var/lib/ironic``.
    This is done to support both PXE and iPXE at the same time.
    Operators doing advanced customisations might need to review the
    relevant defaults section.

    Upgrades of Ironic will now wait for nodes in ``wait`` states to change
    their state. This is to improve the user experience by avoiding
    breaking processes being waited on. This can be disabled by setting
    ``ironic_upgrade_skip_wait_check`` to ``yes``.
