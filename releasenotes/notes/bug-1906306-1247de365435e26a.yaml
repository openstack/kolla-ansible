    Introduced a separate role for managing sysctl settings. This role
    automatically detects support for IPv6 and, if unsupported, skips the IPv6
    sysctl settings. This role expands the previous backportable fix of this
    issue, reviewed at
    https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/kolla-ansible/+/905831. For more
    details, see `LP#1906306 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1906306>`__.
