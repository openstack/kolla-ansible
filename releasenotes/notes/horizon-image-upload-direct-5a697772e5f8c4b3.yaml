    ``HORIZON_IMAGES_UPLOAD_MODE`` is now set to ``'direct'`` by default.
    This improves image uploads from clients, because these no longer use
    Horizon's webserver as a staging area - the image upload goes directly
    to Glance API.
upgrade:

    ``HORIZON_IMAGES_UPLOAD_MODE`` is now set to ``'direct'`` by default.
    In order to retain the previous default (``'legacy'``) - please
    set ``HORIZON_IMAGES_UPLOAD_MODE: 'legacy'`` in your
    ``custom_local_settings`` file.
