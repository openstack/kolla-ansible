    Configure Nova libvirt.num_pcie_ports to 16 by default. Nova currently
    sets 'num_pcie_ports' to "0" (defaults to libvirt's "1"), which is
    not sufficient for hotplug use with 'q35' machine type.

    Fixes an issue where 'q35' libvirt machine type VM could not hotplug
    more than one PCIe device at a time.
