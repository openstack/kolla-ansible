    Configuration has been added to connect Skyline's Prometheus to make the
    Monitor Center work. The latest Skyline Console now includes a Monitor
    Center in the administrator view that displays information from Prometheus.
    For this to work, the Prometheus connection needs to be set up in
    skyline.yaml.
