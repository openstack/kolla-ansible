    The prometheus openstack exporters are now behind haproxy,
    providing a unique time series in the prometheus database.
    Also ensures that only one exporter queries
    the openstack APIs at any given time interval.
    With the previous behavior each openstack exporter
    was scraped at the same time.
    This caused each exporter to query the openstack APIs
    simultaneously introducing unnecessary load and duplicate
    time series in the prometheus database due to the instance
    label being unique for each exporter.
