    Changes the strategy of installing projects in dev mode in containers.
    Instead of bind mounting the project's git repository to the venv
    of the container, the repository is bind mounted to
    /dev-mode/<project_name> from which the it is installed using pip
    on every startup of the container using kolla_install_projects script.
    Also updates docs to reflect the changes.
