    Fixes unable to connect to zun console when
    ``kolla_enable_tls_external`` is true.
    Access to console of any zun container fails when
    ``kolla_enable_tls_external`` is true.
    This fix sets the protocol for wsproxy ``base_url``
    in ``zun.conf`` according to the value of
    ``kolla_enable_tls_external``
