    Fixed an issue during upgrades from 2025.1 to 2025.2 where the Valkey
    role unconditionally referenced the ``redis`` inventory group. Since
    Redis is no longer present in the default inventories, this caused the
    upgrade to fail with an ``AnsibleUndefinedVariable`` error. The upgrade
    logic now correctly handles inventories without a ``redis`` group.
