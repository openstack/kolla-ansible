    Make generation of prometheus.yml consistent when using custom override
    files.

    Previous behaviour would lead to changes in prometheus.yml on every run
    when custom override files were used, as the find result was not sorted.
    This could lead to unnecessary restarts and unreadable diffs of the
    prometheus service.
