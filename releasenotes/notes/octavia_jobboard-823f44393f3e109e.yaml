    The Octavia amphora provider driver improves control plane resiliency.
    Should a control plane host go down during a load balancer provisioning
    operation, an alternate controller can resume the in-process provisioning
    and complete the request. This solves the issue with resources stuck in
    PENDING_* states by writing info about task states in persistent backend
    and monitoring job claims via jobboard. The jobboard feature is now
    enabled by default. It requires the Redis service to be enabled as a
    dependency. Use the ``enable_octavia_jobboard`` variable to override
    if needed.
