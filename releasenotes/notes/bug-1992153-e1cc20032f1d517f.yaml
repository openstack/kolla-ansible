    Kolla Ansible no longer sets ``show_multiple_locations = True`` by default
    when Glance's Ceph RBD backend is enabled. This was applied as a fix but
    operators must note that this, in turn, disables the Cinder's and Nova's
    optimisations. On the other hand, these optimisations might have been
    causing other operators' trouble. Please see the linked bug report.
    Operators relying on this feature can set the flag themselves using service
    config overrides.

    the services running with the recommended Ceph permissions.
