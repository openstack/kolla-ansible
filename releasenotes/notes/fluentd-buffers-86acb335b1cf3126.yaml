    Reduce the size of the fluentd buffers to avoid getting HTTP 413 errors
    when sending logs to opensearch/elasticsearch. The values chosen were based
    on what seemed a sensible size. These can be customised by editing the
    ``fluentd_bulk_message_request_threshold`` and
    ``fluentd_buffer_chunk_limit_size`` variables. `LP#2079988
