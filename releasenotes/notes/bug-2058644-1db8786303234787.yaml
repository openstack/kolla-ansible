upgrade:
  - |
    MariaDB backup now uses the same image as the running MariaDB server. The
    following variables relating to MariaDB backups are no longer used and have
    been removed:

    * ``mariabackup_image``
    * ``mariabackup_tag``
    * ``mariabackup_image_full``
fixes:
  - |
    Modifies the MariaDB procedure to use the same container image as the
    running MariaDB server container. This should prevent compatibility issues
    that may cause the backup to fail.
