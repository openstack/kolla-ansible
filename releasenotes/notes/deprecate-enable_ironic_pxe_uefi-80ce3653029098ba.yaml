deprecations:
  - |
    ``enable_ironic_pxe_uefi`` is deprecated and will be removed in Zed.
    This variable is not documented and results in a broken PXE setup
    for Ironic Inspector.
    The recommended way to support EFI/UEFI deployments in Ironic
    Inspector is to stay with the recommended default of iPXE in Ironic
    Inspector (see docs on ``ironic_dnsmasq_serve_ipxe``).
