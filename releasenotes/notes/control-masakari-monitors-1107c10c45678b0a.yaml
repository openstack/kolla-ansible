    New switches added to control deployment of the Masakari monitors. The
    deployment of each type of monitors can be controlled individually via
    ``enable_masakari_instancemonitor`` and ``enable_masakari_hostmonitor``.
    By default, both are set to ``true`` when the deployment of the Masakari
    is enabled via ``enable_masakari``.
