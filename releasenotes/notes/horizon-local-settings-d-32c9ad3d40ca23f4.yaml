    The Horizon role has been reworked to the preferred local_settings.d
    configuration model. Files ``local_settings`` and ``custom_local_settings``
    have been renamed to ``_9998-kolla-settings.py`` and
    ``_9999-custom-settings.py`` respectively. Users who use Horizon's custom
    configuration must change the names of those files in
    ``/etc/kolla/config/horizon`` as well.
