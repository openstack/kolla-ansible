features:
  - |
    Adds support for exposing Prometheus server on the external interface.
    This is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting
    ``enable_prometheus_server_external`` to ``true``. Basic auth is used to
    protect the endpoint.
  - |
    Adds ``prometheus_external_fqdn`` and ``prometheus_internal_fqdn`` to
    customise prometheus FQDNs.
upgrade:
  - |
    Prometheus now uses basic auth. The password is under the key
    ``prometheus_password`` in the Kolla passwords file. The username is
    ``admin``. The default set of users can be changed using the variable:
    ``prometheus_basic_auth_users``.
