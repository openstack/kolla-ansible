    The config option `rabbitmq_ha_promote_on_shutdown` has been added, which
    allows changing the RabbitMQ definition `ha-promote-on-shutdown`. By
    default `ha-promote-on-shutdown` is "when-synced". We recommend changing
    this to be "always". This basically means we don't mind losing some
    messages, instead we give priority to rabbitmq availability. This is most
    relevant when restarting rabbitmq, such as when upgrading. Note that
    setting the value of this flag, even to the default value of "when-synced",
    will cause RabbitMQ to be restarted on the next deploy.
