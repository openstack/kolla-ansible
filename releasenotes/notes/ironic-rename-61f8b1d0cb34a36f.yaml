    Ironic containers related to PXE (TFTP) and iPXE & direct deploy (HTTP)
    are renamed to better reflect their role: ``ironic_pxe`` is now
    ``ironic_tftp``, while ``ironic_ipxe`` is now ``ironic_http``.
    Operators doing advanced customisations might need to review the
    relevant defaults section.
    Additionally, their respective host groups have changed analogously:
    ``ironic-pxe`` is now ``ironic-tftp``, and ``ironic-ipxe`` is now
    ``ironic-http``.
