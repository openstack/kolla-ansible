upgrade:

    Zun is currently incompatible with Debian Bookworm. This is because Zun
    currently has a hard dependency on a deprecated Docker feature. Operators
    upgrading from Bullseye are strongly encouraged to disable Zun first.
    While workarounds may be possible, none are currently tested in CI.
