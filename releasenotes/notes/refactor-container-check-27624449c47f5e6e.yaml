    Refactor services' check-containers and optimise

    This might fix some hidden bugs where the check tasks forgot to
    include params important for the service.

    We also get a nice optimisation by using a filtered loop instead
    of task skipping per service with 'when'. As proven in
    https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/kolla-ansible/+/914997

    This refactoring allows for further optimisation and
    fixing work to proceed with much less hassle. Including getting
    rid of many notify statements as the restarts are now safely handled
    by check-containers. Some notifies had to stay, because of special
    edge cases eg. in rolling upgrades and loadbalancer config.

    One downside is we remove the little optimisation for Zun that
    ignored config change for copying loopback but this is an
    acceptable tradeoff considering the benefits above.
