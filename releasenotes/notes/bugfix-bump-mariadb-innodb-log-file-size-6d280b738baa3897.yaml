    Increased the default value of ``innodb_log_file_size`` from 96MB to 2GB.
    This change improves overall performance of MariaDB.
    However, the recovery of MariaDB may take longer time as a tradeoff.
    Users can adjust the value by overriding K-A variable
    ``mariadb_innodb_log_file_size_mb``.
    The allowed minimum is 4MB and maximum is 524288MB (512GB)
upgrade:
  - |
    The default value of ``innodb_log_file_size`` has increased from 96MB to
    2GB.
    This improves MariaDB performance but recovery time from crash may take
    longer time as a tradeoff.
    Users are recommended to consider the recovery time with new default
    before upgrade.
    Users are recommended to check if disk space is enough with larger InnoDB
    log file.
