  The Kolla Ansible ``21.0.0`` (Flamingo) release focuses on tightening
  operations for the control plane, database layer, and observability stack
  while following upstream service retirements. Highlights include:

  * Database services now use ``ProxySQL`` by default with ``MariaDB`` adopting
    the upstream ``healthcheck.sh`` script, TLS enabled for all ``MariaDB``
    connections through ``ProxySQL``, and ``Valkey`` replacing ``Redis``. The
    legacy ``HAProxy``/``clustercheck`` path and containers have been removed.
  * Logging and monitoring were overhauled: ``Fluentd`` moved into its own role
    and sends logs directly to ``OpenSearch`` nodes, ``Prometheus``
    node-exporters run from a dedicated role, and ``OpenSearch Dashboards``
    connects to the data nodes without an intermediate ``HAProxy`` hop.
  * Control-plane services gained multiple lifecycle improvements. ``Neutron``
    now mirrors the upstream layout with new maintenance/RPC workers, wrapper
    containers manage the OVN metadata-agent HAProxy processes,
    ``nova-metadata`` runs in its own container, ``Horizon`` uses port ``8080``
    when fronted by ``HAProxy``, and the default ``uWSGI`` provider now covers
    more services.
  * Tooling and reliability improvements: the supported ``ansible`` window is
    11–12, host bootstrap tasks moved into ``ansible-collection-kolla``, CA
    bundle trust paths were aligned on Enterprise Linux hosts, ``mod_oidc``
    gained templated error pages, and several HA fixes landed (Let’s Encrypt
    ACME cleanup, Horizon memcached resilience, RabbitMQ single-node upgrades,
    and ``ProxySQL`` routing improvements).
  * With ``ironic-inspector`` retired upstream, Kolla Ansible now provides the
    ``ironic-pxe-filter`` service to cover bare-metal PXE filtering and removes
    other unused integrations such as ``Venus`` and ``VMware`` drivers.
