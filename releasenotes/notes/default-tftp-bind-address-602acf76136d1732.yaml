upgrade:
  - |
    Now ``ironic_tftp`` service does not bind on 0.0.0.0, by default it uses ip
    address of the ``api_interface``. To revert to the old behaviour, please
    set ``ironic_tftp_interface_address: 0.0.0.0`` in ``globals.yml``.

fixes:
  - |
    Fixes ``ironic_tftp`` which binds to all ip addresses on the system.
    Added ``ironic_tftp_interface``, ``ironic_tftp_address_family`` and
    ``ironic_tftp_interface_address`` parameters to set the address for the
    ``ironic_tftp`` service.
