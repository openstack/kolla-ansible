    The RabbitMQ variable `rabbitmq-ha-promote-on-shutdown` now defaults to
    `"always"`. This only has an effect if
    `om_enable_rabbitmq_high_availability` is set to `True`. When
    `ha-promote-on-shutdown` is set to `always`, queue mirrors are promoted on
    shutdown even if they aren't fully synced. This means that value
    availability over the risk of losing some messages. Note that the contents
    of the RabbitMQ definitions.json are now changed, meaning RabbitMQ
    containers will be restarted on next deploy/upgrade.
