    The ability to override Skyline configuration files has been added. You can
    supply your own versions of nginx.conf for Skyline Console, gunicorn.py,
    and skyline.yaml for the Skyline API Server. Place the files in the skyline
    subfolder of your Kolla config directory; skyline.yaml will be merged with
    the Kolla-provided version.
