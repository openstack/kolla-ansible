  - In the Newton cycle a new kolla-host playbook was
    introduced. The kolla-host playbook is intended to
    prepare servers for use as kolla deployment hosts.
    The kolla-host playbook requires the nodes to have
    an os installed and be reachable via ssh. Currently
    the kolla-host playbook supports ubuntu 14.04,
    ubuntu 16.04 and centos 7.2 as target servers.
    See features section for more details.
features:
  - The kolla-host playbook supports bootstrapping
    clean os installations to enable them to be
    used as kolla hosts. When the playbook completes
    the bootstrapped systems should pass the kolla
    prechecks.
  - The kolla-host playbook will install docker 1.11
    and docker-py on all baremetal nodes.
  - The kolla-host playbook will configure /etc/host
    with the hostname and ip address of all nodes
    in the kolla inventroy if customize_etc_host
    set to its default value of True.
security:
  - The kolla-host playbook will create a kolla user
    on all nodes using the ssh-key specified in the
    passwords.yml. The kolla user will be granted
    passwordless sudo privileges on the host.
    this behavior can be disabled by setting
    create_kolla_user=False
