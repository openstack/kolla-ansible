fixes:
  - |
    Fixed the deployment failure of outward_rabbitmq by resolving port
    conflicts by customizing RabbitMQ's ``prometheus.tcp.port``.
    `LP #1885106 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1885106>`__

upgrade:
  - |
    RabbitMQ's Prometheus plugin is no longer enabled by default
    if Prometheus is not deployed. If external Prometheus is used,
    you need to turn on ``rabbitmq_enable_prometheus_plugin``
    to get old behaviour.
