    Adds ability to configure ProxySQL's max replication lag
    via configuration value ``proxysql_backend_max_replication_lag``
    which is set to default value as per documentation. If it is
    greater than 0, ProxySQL will regularly monitor replication lag
    and if it goes beyond the configured threshold it will temporary
    shun the host until replication catches up. Please see the official
    `upgrade notes <https://proxysql.com/documentation/main-runtime>`__
    for more detail.
