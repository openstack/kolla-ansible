    Since CVE-2022-29404 is fixed the default value for the LimitRequestBody
    directive in the Apache HTTP Server has been changed from 0 (unlimited) to
    1073741824 (1 GiB). This limits the size of images (for example) uploaded
    in Horizon. Now this limit can be configured via
    ``horizon_httpd_limitrequestbody``.
