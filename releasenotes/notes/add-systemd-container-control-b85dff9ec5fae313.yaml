    Adds support for container state control through systemd in kolla_docker.
    Every container logs only to journald and has it's own unit file in
    ``/etc/systemd/system`` named **kolla-<container name>-container.service**.
    Systemd control is implemented in new file
    ``ansible/module_utils/kolla_systemd_worker.py``.
