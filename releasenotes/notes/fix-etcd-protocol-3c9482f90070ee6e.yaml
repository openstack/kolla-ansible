    Fix the configuration of the etcd service so that its protocol is
    independent of the value of the ``internal_protocol`` parameter. The etcd
    service is not load balanced by HAProxy, so there is no proxy
    layer to do TLS termination when ``internal_protocol`` is configured to be
    ``https``.
