    Fix issue with octavia config generation when using
    ``octavia_auto_configure`` and the ``genconfig`` command.
    Note that access to the OpenStack API is necessary for Octavia auto
    configuration to work, even when generating config.
    See `LP#1987299 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1987299>`__
    for more details.
