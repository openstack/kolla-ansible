    Adds the ability for the instance label on prometheus metrics to be
    replaced with the inventory hostname as opposed to using the ip address as
    the metric label. The ip address is still used as the target address which
    means that there is no issue of the hostname being unresolvable.

    More information on how to use this feature can be found in the
    reference documentation for logging and monitoring.
