    Adds the flag ``om_enable_rabbitmq_high_availablity``. Setting this to
    ``true`` will enable both durable queues and classic mirrored queues in
    RabbitMQ. Note that classic queue mirroring and transient (aka non-durable)
    queues are deprecated and subject to removal in RabbitMQ version 4.0 (date
    of release unknown).
    Changes the pattern used in classic mirroring to exclude some queue types.
    This pattern is ``^(?!(amq\\.)|(.*_fanout_)|(reply_)).*``.
