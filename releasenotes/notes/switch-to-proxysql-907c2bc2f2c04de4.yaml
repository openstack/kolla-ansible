    The config option ``enable_proxysql`` has been changed to
    ``yes``, which means that MySQL connections will now be
    handled by ProxySQL by default instead of HAProxy. Users
    who wish to retain load balancing of MySQL connections
    through HAProxy must set ``enable_proxysql`` to ``no``.
    Also Due to this change, the config option
    ``enable_mariadb_clustercheck`` is also dynamically
    changed to ``no``. Users who still wish to maintain
    ``mariadb_clustercheck`` can override this config option
    in the configuration. However, with ProxySQL,
    ``mariadb_clustercheck`` is no longer needed and can be
    manually removed.
