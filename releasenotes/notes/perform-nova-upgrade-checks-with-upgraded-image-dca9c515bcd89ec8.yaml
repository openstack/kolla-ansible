    When upgrading Nova to a new release, we use the tool ``nova-status upgrade
    check`` to make sure that there are no ``nova-compute`` that are older than
    N-1 releases. This was performed using the current ``nova-api`` container,
    so computes which will be too old after the upgrade were not caught. Now
    the upgraded ``nova-api`` container image is used, so older computes are
    identified correctly.
