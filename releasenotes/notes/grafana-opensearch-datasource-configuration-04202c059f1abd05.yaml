    Updated the default Grafana OpenSearch datasource configuration to use
    values for OpenSearch that work out of the box. Replaced the Elasticsearch
    values that were previously being used. The new configuration can be
    applied by deleting your datasource and reconfiguring Grafana through
    Kolla Ansible. To prevent dashboards from breaking when the datasource is
    deleted, one should use `datasource variables
    <https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/variables/add-template-variables/#add-a-data-source-variable>`
    in Grafana. See bug `2039500
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/2039500>`.
