    Kolla Ansible now supports failing execution early if fact collection
    fails on any of the hosts. This is to avoid late failures due to missing
    facts (especially cross-host).
    This is possible by setting
    ``kolla_ansible_setup_any_errors_fatal: true``.
    Do note this still supports host fact caching and it will not affect
    scenarios with all facts cached (as there is no task to fail).
