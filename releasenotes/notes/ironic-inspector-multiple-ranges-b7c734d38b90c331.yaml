features:
  - |
    Adds support for multiple DHCP ranges in the Ironic Inspector DHCP server.

upgrade:
  - |
    Modifies the default lease time of the Ironic Inspector DHCP server to 10
    minutes. This is small enough to use small pools of IP addresses for
    inspection but gives more room for the inspection to succeed.
    This default can be changed globally via
    ``ironic_dnsmasq_dhcp_default_lease_time`` variable or per range via
    ``lease_time`` parameter.
  - |
    Replaced ``ironic_dnsmasq_dhcp_range`` and
    ``ironic_dnsmasq_default_gateway`` in favour of
    ``ironic_dnsmasq_dhcp_ranges``.
    For example, if you have::

      ironic_dnsmasq_dhcp_range: "10.42.0.2,10.42.0.254,255.255.255.0"
      ironic_dnsmasq_default_gateway: "10.42.0.1"

    replace it with::

      ironic_dnsmasq_dhcp_ranges:
        - range: "10.42.0.2,10.42.0.254,255.255.255.0"
          routers: "10.42.0.1"
