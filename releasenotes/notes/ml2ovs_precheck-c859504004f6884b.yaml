    Added a neutron check for ML2/OVS and ML2/OVN presence
    at the start of deploy phase. It will fail if
    neutron_plugin_agent is set to ``ovn`` and use of ML2/OVS
    container detected. In case where neutron_plugin_agent
    is set to ``openvswitch`` the check will fail when it detects
    ML2/OVN container or any of the OVN specific volumes.
