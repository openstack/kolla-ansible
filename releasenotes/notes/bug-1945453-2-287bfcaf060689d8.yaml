    Explicitly removes the ``net.ipv4.ip_forward`` sysctl from
    ``/etc/sysctl.conf`` on hosts with Neutron L3 Agent. In the absence of
    another source for this sysctl, it should revert to the default of 0 after
    the next reboot. This is a follow up to a previous change which stopped
    setting the sysctl, but leaves existing systems with the original value of
    1 set.

    A deployer looking to more aggressively change the value may set
    ``neutron_l3_agent_host_ipv4_ip_forward`` to 0 using a Yoga release of
    Kolla Ansible. This option will be removed in future. Any deployments
    still relying on the previous value may set
    ``neutron_l3_agent_host_ipv4_ip_forward`` to 1.
