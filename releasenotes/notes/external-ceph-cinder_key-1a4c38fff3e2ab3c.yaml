    Fixes external ceph cinder keyring is not imported into libvirt if
    templated.
    Per now, ansible/roles/nova-cell/tasks/external_ceph.yml looks
    cinder_cephx_raw_key up as file from cinder_cephx_keyring_file.stat.path
    To allow templated cinderkeyrings, the lookup is changed to "template"
    Fixes `LP#2089229
