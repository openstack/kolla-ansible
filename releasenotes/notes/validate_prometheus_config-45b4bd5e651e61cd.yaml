    kolla-ansible now validates the Prometheus configuration files when
    called via ``kolla-ansible -i $inventory validate-config``. This
    validation is done by running the ``promtool check config`` command.
    See the `documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/user/multinode.html>`__
    for the ``kolla-ansible validate-config`` command for details.
