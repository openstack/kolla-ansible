    If both Designate and Neutron are enabled, Neutron now uses the
    ``subnet_dns_publish_fixed_ip`` instead of the simpler ``dns``
    extension in order to support more features in the DNS integration.
    Override via the ``neutron_extension_drivers`` config option if this
    is not suitable for your deployment.
