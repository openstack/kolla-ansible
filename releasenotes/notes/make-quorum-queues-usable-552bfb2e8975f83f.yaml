features:
  - |
    You can now enable the usage of quorum queues in RabbitMQ for all services
    by setting the variable ``om_enable_rabbitmq_quorum_queues`` to ``true``.
    Notice that you can't use quorum queues and high availability at the same
    time. This is caught by a precheck.
    This feature is enabled by default to improve reliability of the messaging
    queues.
upgrade:
  - |
    Quorum queues in RabbitMQ (controlled by
    ``om_enable_rabbitmq_quorum_queues`` variable) is enabled by default from
    now on.
    Support for non-HA RabbitMQ queues is dropped. Either quorum queues that
    are enabled by default, or classic mirrored queues are required now.
