    Adds ability to configure the Prometheus pushgateway options of its URL.

    Adds a new variable ``ceilometer_prometheus_pushgateway_options``. This is
    a dictionary whose keys are the options to be set and its values contain
    what to set them to.

    These options and respective values are then added to the pushgateway's
    URL, checking that no "None" value is being set.

    For example, the following configurations:

    .. code-block:: yaml

      ceilometer_prometheus_pushgateway_host: "127.0.0.1"
      ceilometer_prometheus_pushgateway_port: "9091"
      ceilometer_prometheus_pushgateway_options:
          timeout: 180
          max_retries:
          verify_ssl: yes

    Result in the following URL:
    ``prometheus://127.0.0.1:9091/ \
    metrics/job/openstack-telemetry/?timeout=180&verify_ssl=True``
