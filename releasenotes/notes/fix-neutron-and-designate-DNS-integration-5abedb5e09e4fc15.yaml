upgrade:
  - |
    The configuration variable ``designate_enable_notifications_sink`` has
    been changed to ``no``, configuring notifications for designate in neutron,
    nova, and control deployment of ``designate-sink`` which is now optional.

    Operators who want to keep the previous behavior should set this to
    ``true``.

features:
  - |
    New variables have been added to be used by the neutron role,
    ``neutron_dns_integration`` and ``neutron_dns_domain``.
    They allow enabling/disabling internal/external DNS integrations, or their
    combinations.

fixes:
  - |
    The configuration of DNS integrations has been fixed. See `LP##2049503
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/2049503>`__,
    `DNS Integration
    <https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/admin/config-dns-int.html>`__,
    and the `DNS Integration with an External Service
    <https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/admin/config-dns-int-ext-serv.html#config-dns-int-ext-serv>`__
    for details.
