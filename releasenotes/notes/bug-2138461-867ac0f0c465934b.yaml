    Fixed a critical issue in ``kolla-mergepwd`` where the migration from
    Redis to Valkey resulted in authentication failures. The tool now
    automatically inherits the existing ``redis_master_password`` into the
    new ``valkey_master_password`` field during upgrades. This prevents
    serious cluster damage in deployments using custom Keystone caching
    solutions and ensures Octavia remains stable throughout the upgrade
    process, avoiding global ``HTTP 401 Unauthorized`` errors caused by
    password mismatches.
