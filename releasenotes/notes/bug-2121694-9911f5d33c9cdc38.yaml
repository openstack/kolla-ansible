    Fixed an issue where ``neutron-server`` and other neutron agents would
    fail to start when ``kolla_copy_ca_into_containers`` was enabled but
    backend TLS was disabled. The configuration now correctly distinguishes
    between the requirement for backend certificates (``neutron-cert.pem``)
    and the optional copying of CA certificates.
