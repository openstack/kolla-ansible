    Adds support to separate Swift access and replication traffic from other
    storage traffic.

    In a deployment where both Ceph and Swift have been deployed,
    this changes adds functionalality to support optional separation
    of storage network traffic. This adds two new network interfaces
    ``swift_storage_interface`` and ``swift_replication_interface`` which
    maintain backwards compatibility.

    The Swift access network interface is configured via
    ``swift_storage_interface``, which defaults to ``storage_interface``. The
    Swift replication network interface is configured via
    ``swift_replication_interface``, which defaults to
    ``swift_storage_interface``.

    If a separate replication network is used, Kolla Ansible now deploys
    separate replication servers for the accounts, containers and objects,
    that listen on this network. In this case, these services handle only
    replication traffic, and the original account-, container- and object-
    servers only handle storage user requests.
