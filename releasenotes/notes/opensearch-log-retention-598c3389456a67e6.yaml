upgrade:
  - |
    Added log retention in OpenSearch, previously handled by Elasticsearch
    Curator. By default the soft and hard retention periods are 30 and 60 days
    respectively. If you are upgrading from Elasticsearch, and have previously
    configured ``elasticsearch_curator_soft_retention_period_days`` or
    ``elasticsearch_curator_hard_retention_period_days``, those variables will
    be used instead of the defaults. You should migrate your configuration
    to use the new variable names before the Caracal release.
