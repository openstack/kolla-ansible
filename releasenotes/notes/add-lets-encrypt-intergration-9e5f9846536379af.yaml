    deployment. Enables trusted TLS certificate generation option for
    secure communication with OpenStack HAProxy instances using
    ``letsencrypt_email``, ``kolla_internal_fqdn`` and/or
    ``kolla_external_fqdn`` is required. One container runs an Apache
    ACME client webserver and one runs Lego for certificate retrieval
