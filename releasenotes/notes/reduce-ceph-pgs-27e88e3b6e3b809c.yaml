    As of Ceph Luminous 12.2.1 the maximum number of PGs per OSD before the
    monitor issues a warning has been reduced from 300 to 200 PGs. In addition,
    Ceph now fails with an error rather than a warning in the case of exceeding
    the max value.
    In order to allow Kolla to continue to be used out of the box we have
    reduced the default values for pg_num and pgp_num from 128 to 8. This will
    allow a deploy of Kolla with all possible services enabled and then some,
    with the minimum recommended three OSDs.  Operators are *highly*
    recommended to review the Ceph documentation regarding these values in
    order to ensure optimal performance for their own cluster.
