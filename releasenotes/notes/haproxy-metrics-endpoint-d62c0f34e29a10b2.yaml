    Removed configuration and deployment of ``prometheus-haproxy-exporter`` as
    its repository is now archived. We now use the native support for
    Prometheus which is now built into HAProxy. For consistency this is exposed
    on the ``prometheus_haproxy_exporter_port`` port.
    ``prometheus-haproxy-exporter`` containers and config are automatically
    removed.

upgrade:
  - |
    Due to the change from using the ``prometheus-haproxy-exporter`` to using
    the native support for Prometheus which is now built into HAProxy, metric
    names may have been replaced and/or removed, and in some cases the metric
    names may have remained the same but the labels may have changed. Alerts
    and dashboards may also need to be updated to use the new metrics. Please
    review any configuration that references the old metrics as this is not a
    backwards compatible change.
