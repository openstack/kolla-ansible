    In HA mode, parallel restart of neutron-l3-agent containers will cause
    a network outage. Adding routers increases the recovery time. This
    release makes restarts serial and adds a user-configurable delay to ensure
    each agent is returned to operation before the next one is restarted.

    The default value is 0. A nonzero starting value would only result in
    outages if the failover time was greater than the delay, which would be
    more difficult to diagnose than consistent behaviour.
