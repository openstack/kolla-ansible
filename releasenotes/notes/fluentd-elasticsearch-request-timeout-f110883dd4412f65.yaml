    Under circumstances of extended disruption to the Fluentd-ElasticSearch
    central logging pipeline, it is possible to generate a sufficient buffer
    of unsent log data that takes longer than the default Fluentd request
    timeout (default 5 seconds) to transfer the buffer.  The default request
    timeout value is raised to ``60s``, and made configurable using new
    parameter ``fluentd_elasticsearch_request_timeout``. `LP#1983031
