    Starting with Zed, Neutron marked the ``linuxbridge`` ML2 driver
    experimental. The Kolla team has decided to honour the upstream's
    decision and make sure users are aware they are using a badly
    supported driver instead of having it configured out of the box.
    Thus, all users of this driver are advised to get acquainted with
    `Neutron docs <https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/admin/config-experimental-framework.html>`__
    and proceed accordingly.
