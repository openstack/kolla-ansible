    Configuring HAProxy nbproc setting via ``haproxy_processes`` and
    ``haproxy_process_cpu_map`` variables has been dropped since
    threads are the recommended way to scale CPU performance since 1.8.
    This covers ``haproxy``, ``glance-tls-proxy`` and ``neutron-tls-proxy``.
    Please use ``haproxy_threads`` and ``haproxy_thread_cpu_map`` instead
    (or ``glance_tls_proxy_threads`` and ``glance_tls_proxy_thread_cpu_map``
    for Glance TLS proxy and ``neutron_tls_proxy_threads`` and
    ``neutron_tls_proxy_thread_cpu_map`` for Neutron TLS proxy).
