    Setup Skyline to show resources from an external object store in the
    dashboard. If you run an external Swift compatible object store you
    have to tell Skyline about it as it can not use Keystone's endpoint
    api to determine that at runtime. See the reference
    `documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/reference/shared-services/skyline-guide.html#external-swift>`__
    for details.
