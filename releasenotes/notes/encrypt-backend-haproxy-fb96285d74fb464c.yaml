    Adds configuration options to enable backend TLS encryption from HAProxy
    to the Keystone, Glance, Heat, Placement, Horizon, Barbican, and Cinder
    services. When used in conjunction with enabling TLS for service API
    endpoints, network communication will be encrypted end to end, from client
    through HAProxy to the backend service.
