    Implements the HAProxy Admin Socket.
    Allows operators to set the flag ``haproxy_socket_level_admin``
    (default: "no") which adds ``level admin`` to socket that gets created at
    ``/var/lib/kolla/haproxy/haproxy.sock`` inside the HAProxy container.
    This allows operators to interact with HAProxy, including but not limited
    to disabling backend servers for controlled maintenance operations.
