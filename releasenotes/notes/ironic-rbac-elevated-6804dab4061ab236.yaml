    Elevated access for project-scoped service role in Ironic has been
    enabled. Ironic recently started to enforce new policies and scopes,
    and it is one of the few OpenStack projects that require system scope
    for some admin-related API calls. However, Ironic has also begun to
    allow project-scoped behavior for service roles by setting
    ``rbac_service_role_elevated_access``. This change enables this setting
    to achieve similar behavior for service role as other OpenStack projects.
