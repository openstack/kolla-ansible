    ``Neutron`` now runs its API workers under uWSGI and moves auxiliary
    processes into dedicated containers, matching the upstream deployment
    model. TLS is terminated directly on uWSGI, so the ``neutron-tls-proxy``
    service was removed. New containers introduced with this change include:

    * ``neutron-ovn-maintenance-worker``
    * ``neutron-rpc-server``
    * ``neutron-periodic-workers``
