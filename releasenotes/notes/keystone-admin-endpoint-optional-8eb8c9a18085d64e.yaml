upgrade:

    The Keystone's admin endpoint is no longer created by default. Operators
    of existing deployments may wish to remove it after the upgrade
    completes. Operators having external services relying on the availability
    of the Keystone's admin endpoint may set ``keystone_create_admin_endpoint``
    to ``true`` to keep creating the admin endpoint but such support will
    be removed after Zed.
