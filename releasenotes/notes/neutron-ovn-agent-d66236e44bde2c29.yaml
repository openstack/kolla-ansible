    Adds support for deploying ``neutron-ovn-agent``. The agent is disabled
    by default and can be enabled using ``neutron_enable_ovn_agent``.
    This new agent will run on a compute node using OVN as
    network backend, similar to other ML2 mechanism drivers as ML2/OVS or
    ML2/SRIOV. This new agent will perform those actions that the
    ovn-controller service cannot execute.
