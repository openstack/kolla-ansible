    Implemented [Enable Fluentd Plugin Systemd].
    Added the necessary changes and configurations to use the fluentd plugin,
    systemd, to read logs from /var/log/journal by default. This allows us to
    read and manipulate these logs for monitoring purposes.

    These logs will be sent to OpenSearch by default. To disable this behavior,
    set the value of the variable ``enable_fluentd_systemd`` to ``false`` in
    the configuration file ``/etc/kolla/globals.yml``.

    By default, when enabling central logging, we also enable the ``systemd``
    plugin. To disable this behavior when central logging is enabled, set the
    value of the variable ``enable_fluentd_systemd`` to ``false`` in the
    configuration file ``/etc/kolla/globals.yml``.
