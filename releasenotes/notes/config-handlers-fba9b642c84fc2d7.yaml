    Performance: Don't notify handlers during config

    This patch builds upon genconfig optimisation and it takes it
    further by not having genconfig ever touch the handlers!
    Calling the handlers and skipping them created an unnecessary slow down
    if only config was ran. It also depends on the config checking fix.

    This gets us closer to the single responsibility principle -
    config only generates the config, container checks only validate
    whether container restart is needed.

    And this also means that we will have single place were containers
    are restarted, were we can fix the ansible quirk of it restarting
    the whole group even when one container changed in the following patches.

    The only exception is the loadbalance role. As the loadbalancer services
    have their config altered by other roles registering their services
    using loadbalancer-config. This is in contrast to typical roles,
    which do config in one step and can then run check-containers in
    the next step.

fixes:

    Fixes some handlers that were missing the necessary guard,
    making genconfig actually able to restart some containers.
