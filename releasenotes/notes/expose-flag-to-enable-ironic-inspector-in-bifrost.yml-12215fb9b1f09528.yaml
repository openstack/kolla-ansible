    Exposed a flag, `bifrost_enable_ironic_inspector`, to enable
    ironic-inspector in Bifrost. This option defaults to `True` as it can be
    useful for backwards compatibility. It still allows using native in-band
    inspection when Ironic Inspector is enabled by setting `inspect_interface`
    to `agent`. Please see the Ironic documentation for more details.
