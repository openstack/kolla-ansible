    Fixes an issue with Prometheus scraping when targets' Ansible inventory
    hostnames (``inventory_hostname``) do not resolve to reachable IP
    addresses. Reverts to the previous behaviour of using IP addresses to
    communicate with targets. The side effect of this is that targets instances
    will again be labelled using IP addresses rather than hostnames.
