upgrade:
  - |
    A precheck for running Cinder HA has been introduced, which checks
    for multiple cinder-volume instances and fails when ``cinder_cluster_name``
    is unset. For details on configuration guidelines please check the
    `HA section of Cinder guide <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/reference/storage/cinder-guide.html#ha>`_.
    To disable the precheck please set ``cinder_cluster_skip_precheck`` to
    ``true``.
features:
  - |
    A new variable ``cinder_cluster_name`` which controls the name of
    cinder-volume High Availability cluster (for those backend drivers
    that support it).
    It replaces possible user-defined config overrides that already may have
    implemented this feature.
