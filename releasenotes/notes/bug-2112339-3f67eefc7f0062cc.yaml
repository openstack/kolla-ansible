    Improves ProxySQL routing by setting ``default_hostgroup`` for every
    MariaDB user and by adding user-based rules alongside the schema-based
    rules. Statements that run before a schema is selected (for example
    ``SET AUTOCOMMIT`` or ``ROLLBACK``) now land in a valid hostgroup instead
    of failing against ``NULL`` backends.
