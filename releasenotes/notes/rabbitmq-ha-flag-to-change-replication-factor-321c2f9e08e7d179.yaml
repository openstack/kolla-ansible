    The config option `rabbitmq_ha_replica_count` is added, to allow for
    changing the replication factor of mirrored queues in RabbitMQ. While the
    flag is unset, the queues are mirrored across all nodes using
    "ha-mode":"all". Note that this only has an effect if the flag
    ` om_enable_rabbitmq_high_availability` is set to `True`, as otherwise
    queues are not mirrored.
