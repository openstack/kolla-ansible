    certificate generation.

    Users who have previously used the letsencrypt role for an
    external certificate generation need to migrate their previous
    default value (or their overridden value) of the variable
    ``letsencrypt_cert_server`` and set it to
    ``letsencrypt_external_cert_server``.The default value was
    ``https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory``
