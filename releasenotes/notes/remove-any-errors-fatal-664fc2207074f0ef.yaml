    Support for failing execution early if fact collection fails on any of the
    hosts by setting ``kolla_ansible_setup_any_errors_fatal`` to ``true`` has
    been removed. This is due to Ansible's ``any_errors_fatal`` parameter not
    being templated, resulting in the value always being interpreted as
    ``true``, even though the default value of
    ``kolla_ansible_setup_any_errors_fatal`` is ``false``.

    Equivalent behaviour is possible by setting the maximum failure percentage
    to 0. This may be done specifically for fact gathering using
    ``gather_facts_max_fail_percentage`` or globally using
    ``kolla_max_fail_percentage``.
