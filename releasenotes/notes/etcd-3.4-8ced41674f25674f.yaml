upgrade:
  - |
    `etcd` has been upgraded to version `3.4` in this release. Operators are
    highly encouraged to read the `upgrade notes <https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4/upgrades/upgrade_3_4/>`__
    for impacts on `etcd` clients. Upgrades are only supported from
    `etcd v3.3`: Skip version upgrades are not supported. Please ensure that
    adequate backups are taken before running the upgrade to guard against
    dataloss.

    `etcd` version `3.4` drops support for the `v3alpha` endpoint. Internal
    kolla-ansible endpoints have been updated, but operators are strongly
    encouraged to audit any customizations or external users of `etcd`.
