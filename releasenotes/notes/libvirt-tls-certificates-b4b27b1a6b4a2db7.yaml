    Adds support to the ``kolla-ansible certificates`` command for generating
    certificates for libvirt TLS, when ``libvirt_tls`` is ``true``. The same
    certificate and key are used for the libvirt client and server.

    The certificates use the same root CA as the other generated certificates,
    and are written to ``{{ node_custom_config }}/nova/nova-libvirt/``, ready
    to be picked up by nova-libvirt and nova-compute.
