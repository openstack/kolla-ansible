    Rewrite kolla-ansible CLI in Python. Moving the CLI to Python allows for
    easier maintenance and larger feature set. The CLI was built using the
    cliff package that is used in the ``openstack`` and ``kayobe`` commands.

    This patch introduces a few breaking changes stemming from the nature of
    the cliff package:

    * the order of parameters must be ``kolla-ansible <action> <arguments>``
    * ``mariadb_backup`` and ``mariadb_recovery`` now are ``mariadb-backup``
      and ``mariadb-recovery``

    The ``--key`` parameter has also been dropped as it was duplicating
    ``--vault-password-file``.
