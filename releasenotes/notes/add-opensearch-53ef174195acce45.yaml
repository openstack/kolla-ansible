features:
  - |
    Adds support for deploying OpenSearch and OpenSearch dashboards. These
    services directly replace ElasticSearch and Kibana which are now
    end-of-life. Support for sending logs to a remote ElasticSearch (or
    OpenSearch) cluster is maintained.
upgrade:
  - |
    If you are currently deploying ElasticSearch with Kolla Ansible, you
    should backup the data before starting the upgrade. The contents of
    the ElasticSearch data volume will be automatically moved to
    the OpenSearch volume. The ElasticSearch, ElasticSearch Curator and
    Kibana containers will be removed automatically. The inventory must be
    updated so that the ``elasticsearch`` group is renamed to
    ``opensearch``, and the `kibana` group is renamed to
    ``opensearch-dashboards``.
