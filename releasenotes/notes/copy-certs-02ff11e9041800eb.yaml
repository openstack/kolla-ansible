    Fixes unwanted restarts during copying of certificates.
    By removing conditional statements from role handlers in #745164,
    copying certificates caused containers to restart, this is unwanted
    during the genconfig process. However, if we would remove handler
    notifiers from copying certificates, the container would never
    restart, since from #745164, containers will restart only if any
    of the files specified in config.json change.
    So this adds certificate folder to config.json file for containers.
    Certificates are copied to intermediary location inside of the
    container, from which the script kolla_copy_cacerts will install them
    in the system's trust store.
