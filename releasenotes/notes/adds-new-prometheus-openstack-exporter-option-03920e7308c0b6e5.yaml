    Adds a new, disabled by default, option for Prometheus
    OpenStack exporter, named
    "enable_prometheus_openstack_exporter_external".
    This option allows exposing OpenStack exporter through
    HAProxy, and may be used to expose OpenStack metrics
    to an existing Prometheus server outside the OpenStack
    cloud, instead of using the default one provided by
    OpenStack.
