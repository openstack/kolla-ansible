    Fixed an issue where the MariaDB Cluster recovery process would fail if the
    sequence number was not found in the logs. The recovery process now checks
    the complete log file for the sequence number and recovers the cluster.
    See `LP#1821173 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1821173>`__
    for details.
